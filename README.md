Data Science with Gen AI - Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Assignment

Objective: The objective of this assessment is to evaluate the understanding and ability to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset.
Dataset: Iris dataset available in the sklearn library.

Key components fulfilled:
Loading and Preprocessing
● Loaded and preprocessed the Iris dataset from sklearn.
● Dropped the species column since this is a clustering problem.

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the scaled features to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
Used the first two principal components to visualize the data and the resulting clusters in 2D while retaining most of the variance in the dataset.

Implemented the following two clustering algorithms:
1. KMeans Clustering
2. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
